# Neural Networks and CNN

Implemented the forward pass of LeNet (CNN) from Scratch and a 3 layer neural network from scratch with multiple activation functions. Compared their accuracies with 2 datasets.

## File Structure

* LeNetForward.py

Contains the code for forward pass of LeNet from scratch

* NNonDerma.py

3 Layer Neural Network on Dermatology Dataset

* NNonPenDigits.py

3 Layer Neural Network on Pen Digits Dataset

Both Neural Networks contain a choice of Activation Function and tests accuracies on various number of hidden units
